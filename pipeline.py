"""Your ML pipeline: the DAG. Structure and nothing else.

Each step declares its name, the config sections it reads (reads=), whether it
needs a GPU (gpu=True), what it depends on (needs=), any small result files it
writes (outputs=), and an optional condition (when=). Every tunable parameter
lives in the config/ tree and reaches the submit form automatically — there is
no parameter wiring here.

Conditions reference derived form parameters by name (config path,
dots->dashes): quantization.mode -> quantization-mode.

See README.md / DEVELOPER.md to add a step or a parameter.
